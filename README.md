# Cryptopals-solutions

Solutions to cryptopals challenges. All code here is written in python 3.6.

## Set 1 : Basics

1. [Convert hex to base64](./Set1/1.py)  
A simple problem. I used python base64 library to solve this.

2. [Fixed XOR](./Set1/2.py)  
Another simple one. I used a for loop to xor the two hex strings digitwise.
